The repository includes different analyses related to a semi-automated 3D digital method to systematically quantify stone tool edge angle and design ("3D-EdgeAngle"). All details including a description of the method and the scripts to use the method can be found here:  

The first analysis was done in R. The scripts format and sort the data acquired with "3D-EdgeAngle" so that the results are saved in one single R file per analysis (per sample). 

The second analysis was done in Python (files named "EdgeAngles". The script deals with the statistical analysis of the acquired data.
